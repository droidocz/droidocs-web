Although there are many types of ListView controls across platforms and operating-systems, generally it is considered to be a type of enhanced list control with support for features such as columns (and column headers) and per-item images.


The ListView control is used extensively in the Windows UI shell, providing the display surface for the Explorer's folder view, for example. The control itself is provided by the Common Controls library and can be used by any application to display data.


ListView controls are sometimes also called [gridview](/questions/tagged/gridview "show questions tagged 'gridview'") in some platforms. In others, such as GTK+ they are implemented as a kind of columnar TreeView.
