## Context

This button disappeared from a new 3.1 version of AS Toolbar. Before it showed as:

Now it's missing:

**EDIT**: They like to keep playing with the toolbar.


Since Android Studio 3.3, the icon has been updated and moved back across to the right:

Original answer:


It hasn't disappeared. They have just moved it between the Save and Sync files button on the far left end of the toolbar.
