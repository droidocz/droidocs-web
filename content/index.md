Droidocs is an automatically generated documentation for the Android API, with data from Stackoverflow.

# Why?
Building and keeping documentation updated is not always easy, it takes time and it's not the most appealing task developers are willing to take :).
In the meanwhile, we kept Q&A discussions rich and active when trying to understand how to approach coding tasks we were struggling with. The result is a vast amount of valuable content data in those platforms.
So, the goal with this website work is to select and treat some of this data, while giving it a more suitable format for community maintenance.
