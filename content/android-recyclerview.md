The **[RecyclerView](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v7/widget/RecyclerView.html)** widget is a more advanced and flexible version of `ListView` and `GridView`. This widget is a container for displaying large datasets that can be scrolled very efficiently by maintaining a limited number of views. Use the `RecyclerView` widget when you have data collections whose elements change at runtime based on user action or network events.


â€¢ See how to [**create a list with RecyclerView**](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/layout/recyclerview).

The `RecyclerView` class simplifies the display and handling of large data sets by providing:


1. [Layout Manager](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v7/widget/RecyclerView.LayoutManager)s for positioning items
2. Default animations for common item operations, such as removal or addition of items
