I download an APK file and I want to run it on an Android emulator but I don't know how. Please help me. Thanks!

Start an Android Emulator (make sure that all supported APIs are included when you created the emulator, we needed to have the Google APIs for instance).


Then simply email yourself a link to the .apk file, and download it directly in the emulator, and click the downloaded file to install it.

## Notes

- Your answer gave me an idea; i just put my apk file inside the phone and ran it.
