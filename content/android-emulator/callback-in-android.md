## Context

In Android application development, I frequently go through the word `CallBack` in many places. I want to know what it means to tell us technically - and how I can manage to use the `callback` in applications. I need a guide to understand it and use it.

"In object-oriented programming languages without function-valued arguments, such as Java, [callbacks] can be simulated by passing an abstract class or interface, of which the receiver will call one or more methods, while the calling end provides a concrete implementation. Such objects are effectively a bundle of callbacks, plus the data they need to manipulate. They are useful in implementing various design patterns such as Visitor, Observer, and Strategy."
