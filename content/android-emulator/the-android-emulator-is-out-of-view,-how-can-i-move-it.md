## Problem

I used an additional display with my laptop and moved the Android emulator there. It seems to remember the location even if the display is not connected anymore.


Is there any way to reset the position of the window so it becomes visible again?

## Solution

You can use this Method for moving any window that is off the screen in a windows environment.


* First Select the window either by Alt-Tab or Click clicking it
* Press Alt & Space keys together
* Press "M" or select it with the mouse Use your arrow keys to move the Window
* Press Enter to exit


This is far easier than editing any files.

## Notes

- Sorry, I know this is the standard Windows short-cut for moving windows, however, for some reason I'm not able to move my AVD window at all.
- Using the arrow keys worked for me while editing the emulator-user.ini file stopped working (tried both API 21 & 22 AVDs).
- Use arrow keys at the end.
