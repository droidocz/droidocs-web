## Notes

- Home Key is FN + left_arrow on Macbook keyboards
-  that link works just fine for me; it simply redirects to http://developer.android.com/tools/help/emulator.html.
- That link no longer seems to have any info about keyboard shortcuts(I'm guessing Google moved docs around which they seem to do a lot). The correct Google Doc now appears to be developer.android.com/tools/help/emulator.html, but I'll post an answer with all the shortcuts listed here so we actually have the data here.
